## Codebase for the Coforma website

I liked the light-weight appearance of the [Alphabet website](https://www.abc.xyz) when it was established as the parent company of Google and its various enterprises. I've ungraciously cloned the Alphabet website using wget and modified the code to be even more light-weight and suitable as a landing page for Coforma.

This is a simple website with two pages - a landing page and a contact page. Nothing more. The content is simple and is hard-coded on each page. The site's code structure remains the same as the Alphabet website when I cloned it.
