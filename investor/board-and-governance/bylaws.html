(PDF)</a><br>(amended and restated on October 19, 2022)</p><p>ARTICLE I - CORPORATE OFFICES </p><p>1.1 REGISTERED OFFICE.<br>The registered office of Alphabet Inc. shall be fixed in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (as so amended and/or restated, the “Certificate”).</p><p>1.2 OTHER OFFICES.<br>The corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.</p><p>ARTICLE II - MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS</p><p>2.1 PLACE OF MEETINGS.<br>Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as designated by the Board. The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In the absence of any such designation or determination, stockholders’ meetings shall be held at the corporation’s principal executive office.</p><p>2.2 ANNUAL MEETING.<br>The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board. At the annual meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.</p><p>2.3 SPECIAL MEETING.<br>Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate, special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time, for any purpose or purposes, only by (i) the Board, (ii) the Chair of the Board, (iii) the chief executive officer of the corporation, or (iv) holders of more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation then entitled to vote.</p><p>If any person(s) other than the Board calls a special meeting, the request shall:</p><p>(i) be in writing;</p><p>(ii) specify the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted; and</p><p>(iii) be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by facsimile transmission to the secretary of the corporation.</p><p>Upon receipt of such a request, the Board shall determine the date, time and place of such special meeting, which must be scheduled to be held on a date that is within ninety (90) days of receipt by the secretary of the request therefor, and the secretary of the corporation shall prepare a proper notice thereof. No business may be transacted at such special meeting other than the business specified in the notice to stockholders of such meeting.<a class="Link" href="https://www.usa.gov/laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0"> </a></p><p>2.4 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS’ MEETINGS.<br>All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with either Section 2.5 or Section 8.1 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and, unless the Certificate provides otherwise, any special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled by resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.</p><p>Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.</p><p>Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any stockholder to whom (a) notice of two (2) consecutive annual meetings, or (b) all, and at least two (2) payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a twelve (12) month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at such person’s address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth such person’s then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL.</p><p>The exception in subsection (a) of the above paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission. The exception in subsection (a) of the above paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any stockholder whose electronic mail address appears on the records of the corporation and to whom notice by electronic transmission is not prohibited by Section 232 of the DGCL.</p><p>2.5 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE.<br>Whenever, by applicable law, the Certificate or these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given in writing directed to such stockholder’s mailing address or by electronic transmission directed to such stockholder’s electronic mail address, as applicable, as it appears on the records of the corporation, or by such other form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder. Notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given:</p><p>(i) if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid;</p><p>(ii) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder’s address;</p><p>(iii) if given by electronic mail, when directed to such stockholder’s electronic mail address unless the stockholder has notified the corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by Section 232(e) of the DGCL; and</p><p>(iv) if given by a form of electronic transmission, as provided in Section 8.1 of these bylaws.</p><p>An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or of the transfer agent or any other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.</p><p>Any notice given by electronic mail must include a prominent legend that the communication is an important notice regarding the corporation.</p><p>Notice may be waived in accordance with Section 7.13 of these bylaws.</p><p>2.6 QUORUM.<br>Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate or required by law, stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the corporation, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. If such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then the chair of the meeting, or the stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the capital stock at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.</p><p>2.7 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE.<br>When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place not more than thirty (30) days from the date of the original meeting (including an adjournment taken to address a technical failure to convene or continue a meeting using remote communication), the corporation shall, in accordance with the DGCL, not be required to provide separate notice of the adjourned meeting if the time, place if any thereof, and the means of remote communications if any by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are (i) announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken and (ii) displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication. At the continuation of the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 and 2.5 of these bylaws.</p><p>2.8 ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEETING.<br>Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chair of the Board or, in the absence thereof, by such person as the chair of the Board shall appoint, or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the chair shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the Board. In the absence of the secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chair of the meeting appoints.</p><p>The Board shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one (1) or more inspector(s), who may include individual(s) who serve the corporation in other capacities, including without limitation as officers, employees or agents, to act at the meeting of stockholders and make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one (1) or more persons as alternate inspector(s) to replace any inspector, who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chair of the meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspector(s) to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector(s) or alternate(s) shall have the duties prescribed pursuant to Section 231 of the DGCL or other applicable law.</p><p>The Board shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chair of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chair, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).</p><p>2.9 VOTING.<br>The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.</p><p>Except as otherwise provided in the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL (relating to the fixing of a date for determination of stockholders of record) or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to that number of votes for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder as set forth in the Certificate.</p><p>In all matters, except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Directors shall be elected by a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.</p><p>The stockholders of the corporation shall not have the right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors of the corporation.</p><p>2.10 NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING.<br>Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation (if the corporation has more than one stockholder at such time) must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.</p><p>2.11 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS.<br>In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other such action.</p><p>If the Board does not fix a record date in accordance with these bylaws and applicable law:</p><p>(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.</p><p>(ii) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is necessary, shall be the first day on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation.</p><p>(iii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.</p><p>A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.</p><p>2.12 PROXIES.<br>Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it as proxy in the manner(s) provided under Section 212(c) of the DGCL or as otherwise provided under Delaware law. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.</p><p>Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board.</p><p>2.13 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE.<br>The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation’s principal place of business.</p><p>In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.</p><p>2.14 ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS.<br>Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (c) a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL that has been properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.14 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14.

The Board, any committee thereof, any officer of the corporation authorized by the Board or such committee, and the chair of the meeting shall have discretion to determine whether any stockholder intending to bring any item of business has fully complied with these bylaws and with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and may disregard the proposal of any business determined not to be made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. To facilitate the making of any such determination, at the corporation’s request, any stockholder intending to bring any item of business before a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation must provide, not later than five (5) business days in advance of the meeting, written certifications as to his or her compliance and any evidentiary materials to support the basis for such certifications.</p><p>In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice pursuant to this Section 2.14 or Section 2.15 below, unless a written exemption is requested and approved by the Board, any committee thereof, any officer of the corporation authorized by the Board or such committee, or the chair of the meeting.</p><p>2.15 ADVANCE NOTICE OF DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS.<br>Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate with respect to the right of holders of Preferred Stock of the corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors. To be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, or any special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, nominations for the election of director must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (b) made by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) made by any stockholder of the corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.15 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.15 and with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (including Rule 14a-19 thereunder).</p><p>In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder of record, such stockholder of record must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice to the secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, in the case of an annual meeting, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.14, and, in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs.</p><p>To be in proper written form, such stockholder’s notice to the secretary must include:</p><p>A. as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by the person, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (v) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including without limitation such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected);</p><p>B. a copy of a fully completed and executed Director Questionnaire and a duly executed written representation and agreement by each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, both in the forms required by the corporation (which shall be provided upon written request made by a stockholder of record at the time of such request);</p><p>C. the information required to be provided pursuant to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act with respect to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director; and</p><p>D. as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to Section 2.14.</p><p>In addition, a stockholder who has delivered a notice of nomination pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall, in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, promptly certify to the secretary of the corporation, and notify the secretary of the corporation in writing, that such stockholder has met and complied with all of the requirements of these bylaws and of Rule 14a-19(a) (including for the avoidance of doubt Rule 14a-19(a)(3), which provides that a stockholder soliciting proxies in support of director nominees other than the corporation’s nominees must solicit the holders of shares representing at least 67% of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors) and, upon request of the corporation, shall, not later than five (5) business days prior to the date of the applicable meeting of stockholders, deliver to the corporation reasonable evidence of such compliance.</p><p>The stockholder(s) providing such notice and, if applicable, the proposed nominee for election as a director, shall update and supplement the notice to the corporation, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice or accompany such notice pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be true and correct (i) as of the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders and (ii) as of the day that is ten (10) business days prior to such meeting or any adjournment thereof. Such update and supplement shall be in writing and must be received by the secretary of the corporation (x) in the case of the foregoing clause (i), not later than five (5) business days after the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, and (y) in the case of the foregoing clause (ii), not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date of the meeting, or any adjournment thereof. Further, the Board may request any nominating stockholder and proposed nominee to furnish any additional information as may be reasonably required or appropriate for the Board’s review and consideration, and such nominating stockholder and/or proposed nominee shall provide such additional information within ten (10) business days after it has been requested by the Board. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to update and supplement as set forth in this paragraph shall not limit the corporation’s rights with respect to any deficiencies in any notice provided by a stockholder, and any such deficiencies may be grounds for exclusion of the stockholder’s nominee.</p><p>Except as set forth in the above two paragraphs with respect to the certification and updated notice(s), any notice of nomination delivered by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.15 and in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act in compliance with the notice periods set forth in Section 2.14 shall be deemed to have been made not in accordance with these bylaws.</p><p>Subject to the rights of any holders of Preferred Stock of the corporation, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.15 and with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (including Rule 14a-19 thereunder). If the chair of the meeting properly determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chair shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

The Board may delegate authority over the foundation to one or more persons who are not directors of the corporation with the approval of two-thirds of the members of the Board.</p><p>ARTICLE VIII - NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION</p><p>8.1 NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION.<br>Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice or electronic transmission to the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice may not be given by an electronic transmission from and after the time that:</p><p>(i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation; and</p><p>(ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.</p><p>However, the inadvertent failure to discover such inability shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p><p>Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:</p><p>A. if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;</p><p>B. if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (a) such posting and (b) the giving of such separate notice; and</p><p>C. if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.</p><p>An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.</p><p>8.2 DEFINITIONS.<br>As used in these bylaws:</p><p>An “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process;</p><p>An “electronic mail” means an electronic transmission directed to a unique electronic mail address (which electronic mail shall be deemed to include any files attached thereto and any information hyperlinked to a website if such electronic mail includes the contact information of an officer or agent of the corporation who is available to assist with accessing such files and information); and</p><p>An “electronic mail address” means a destination, commonly expressed as a string of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox (commonly referred to as the “local part” of the address) and a reference to an internet domain (commonly referred to as the “domain part” of the address), whether or not displayed, to which electronic mail can be sent or delivered.</p><p>8.3 INAPPLICABILITY.<br>Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (attachment of shares of stock) of the DGCL.</p><p>ARTICLE IX - INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS</p><p>9.1 POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN THOSE BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION.<br>Subject to Section 9.3 of this Article IX, the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the corporation or any predecessor of the corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.</p><p>9.2 POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION.<br>Subject to Section 9.3 of this Article IX, the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the corporation or any predecessor of the corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.</p><p>9.3 AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION.<br>Any indemnification under this Article IX (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Article IX, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.</p><p>9.4 GOOD FAITH DEFINED.<br>For purposes of any determination under Section 9.3 of this Article IX, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful, if such person’s action is based on the records or books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The term “another enterprise” as used in this Section 9.4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 9.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of this Article IX, as the case may be.</p><p>9.5 INDEMNIFICATION BY A COURT.<br>Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 9.3 of this Article IX, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Article IX. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of this Article IX, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 9.3 of this Article IX nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be given to the corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.</p><p>9.6 EXPENSES PAYABLE IN ADVANCE.<br>To the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law, expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advance of expenses incurred by any person in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article IX.</p><p>9.7 NONEXCLUSIVITY OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.<br>The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate, any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Article IX shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article IX shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of this Article IX but whom the corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.</p><p>9.8 INSURANCE.<br>To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX.</p><p>9.9 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.<br>For purposes of this Article IX, references to “the corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article IX with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article IX, references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the corporation” as referred to in this Article IX.</p><p>9.10 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.<br>The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article IX shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal and legal representatives of such a person.</p><p>9.11 LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION.<br>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IX to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 9.5 hereof), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the board of directors of the corporation.</p><p>9.12 INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.<br>The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the corporation similar to those conferred in this Article IX to directors and officers of the corporation.</p><p>9.13 EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.<br>Neither any amendment or repeal of any Section of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of the Certificate or the bylaws inconsistent with this Article IX, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or other agent established pursuant to this Article IX existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision, including without limitation by eliminating or reducing the effect of this Article IX, for or in respect of any act, omission or other matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise), prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.</p><p>ARTICLE X - AMENDMENTS</p><p>The bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate, also confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the Board. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>ALPHABET INC.<br>a Delaware corporation<br>CERTIFICATE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS</p><p>The undersigned hereby certifies that he or she is the duly elected, qualified, and acting Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet Inc., a Delaware corporation, and that the foregoing bylaws, comprising twenty-seven (27) pages, were adopted as the corporation’s bylaws as of October 19, 2022 by the corporation’s board of directors on October 19, 2022.</p><p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has hereunto set his or her hand this 19th day of October 2022.</p><p>/s/ Sundar Pichai<br>Sundar Pichai<br>Chief Executive Officer</p><p><a class="Link" href="bylaws.html#top" data-cms-ai="0">Back to top</a></p>
